# Master-Thesis: Classical networks for the Hubbard model with a tilted potential

The work for my Master-Thesis is split into multiple repositories (links for quick access, it may be possible that the repo is private).

-   [Latex Documents, Reports and Notes](https://github.com/jonas-kell/master-thesis-documents)
-   [Final Code to produce Measurements](https://github.com/jonas-kell/master-thesis-code)
-   [The MATH-MANIPULATOR project, developed in conjunction with the thesis/practical training](https://github.com/jonas-kell/math-manipulator)
-   [A repository that holds calculations done with the MATH-MANIPULATOR tool](https://github.com/jonas-kell/master-thesis-mm-calculations)
